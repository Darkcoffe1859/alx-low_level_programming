A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure used in computer science and programming for efficient data storage and retrieval. It is an implementation of an associative array, which allows the storage of key-value pairs.

In a hash table, data is stored and accessed using a hash function. The hash function takes a key as input and computes a hash code, which is typically an integer value. This hash code is used as an index or address to store the corresponding value in an array-like structure called a hash table.

The main advantage of using a hash table is its ability to provide constant-time average-case complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, making it highly efficient for large data sets. However, in rare cases, due to collisions (different keys mapping to the same hash code), the performance may degrade, leading to slower operations.

To handle collisions, various techniques such as chaining or open addressing are used. Chaining involves maintaining a linked list or another data structure at each index of the hash table to store multiple values that have the same hash code. Open addressing, on the other hand, involves finding the next available slot in the hash table to store the value when a collision occurs.

Hash tables are widely used in various applications and programming languages due to their efficiency in storing and retrieving data. They are particularly useful for tasks such as caching, symbol tables, and implementing dictionaries or associative arrays.
